## Behaviorial Cloning Project

#### Overview

This repository contains Created, tested and modified files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project,I have used information on deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior.

Keras using a backend of tensorflow was utilized.

Simulator provided by Udacity was used which provided camera images from Center, Left and Right cameras along with steerng angles.

Also, Brake, throttle and speed are also provided as values from the simulator.

### Dependencies

##### This lab requires:

CarND Term1 Starter Kit
The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click here for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:

* drive.py

* video.py

* Writeup

* Model.py (file that lists the keras model created for the lab)

* Behaviourcloning_model.ipynb (Jupyter notebook for final model)

* run1 (video of initial run of model)

* run3 (Video of final model run on track 1)
* run3_track2 (Video of final model run on track 2)
